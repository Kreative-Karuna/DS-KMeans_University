# DS-KMeans_University


# K-Means Clustering Algorithm - Data Mining (Machine Learning) Unsupervised learning Algorithm

# Business Problem Statement:
    Students have to evaluate a lot of factors before taking a decision to join a university for their higher education requirements.

# `CRISP-ML(Q)` process model describes six phases:
 1. Business and Data Understanding
 2. Data Preparation
 3. Model Building
 4. Evaluation
 5. Deployment
 6. Monitoring and Maintenance

# Objective : Maximize the convenience of admission process
# Constraints: Minimize the brain drain

### Success Criteria

# Business Success Criteria: Reduce the application process time from anywhere between 20% to 40%
# ML Success Criteria: Achieve Silhoutte coefficient of atleast 0.5
# Economic Success Criteria: US Higher education department will see an increase in revenues by atleast 30%

# **Proposed Plan:**
 Grouping the available universities will allow to understand the characteristics of each group.


## Data Collection

# Data: 
    The university details are obtained from the US Higher Education Body and is publicly available for students to access.
